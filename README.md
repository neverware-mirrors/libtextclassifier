# libtextclassifier

A library for on-device text classification (address, telephone number,
emails etc.).

# Usage in Chrome OS

To use libtextclassifier, one also needs to install a flatbuffer model defined
in "model.fbs". For simplicity, this model file will be installed in the
[ebuild of ml-service][ml-9999-ebuild].

And libtextclassifier currently [depends on][tclib-depend-chrome-icu] the
[chrome-icu][chrome-icu-ebuild-folder] package which requires explicitly
initializing the icu data, just like [chrome][chrome-init-icu].

The [ml-service] is currently the only user of this library. If another library
in Chrome OS also wants to use it, please let the owners of [ml-service] and
libtextclassifier know because then,

1. we need to make libtextclassifier into a shared library to save space;
2. we may also need to move the installation of libtextclassifier's model file
into libtextclassifier's ebuild.
